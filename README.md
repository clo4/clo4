### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a developer based in Sydney. I'm interested in basically anything obscure but cool, currently obsessing over Nix.

Previously I was the lead support engineer at [Fig](https://fig.io) and a maintainer of [withfig/autocomplete](https://github.com/withfig/autocomplete) â€” and a very frequent contributor to it too! I wrote possibly the fastest (?) [command-line argument parser for JS/TS](https://github.com/clo4/run-fig) but abandoned it because, in general, it's a worse experience for the user overall when the CLI isn't written in a compiled language.

I also wrote the [best<sup>\*</sup> API wrapper for Jamf School](https://github.com/clo4/deno_jamf_school), and a bunch of other libraries necessary for it including [deno_mock_fetch](https://github.com/clo4/deno_mock_fetch) and [apple_device_identifiers](https://github.com/clo4/apple_device_identifiers).

<sup>(* = it has no competition, but I think it's great)</sup>

There's also a couple of *old* projects on PyPI that I won't link to, but the total downloads are nearly 80,000 ðŸ˜¬
