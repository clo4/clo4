### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Some facts about me: I...
- am based in Sydney, Australia
- use a Moonlander as my keyboard (layout is colemak-dh), thanks to RSI
- stay in my shell as much as possible (Fish, Helix, Tmux, etc.)
- can't be bothered to update my public dotfiles repo because my setup is a cross-platform nightmare at the moment
- recently rebranded to clo4 because my old username was _way_ too long ðŸ˜…

Some stuff that I've worked on in the past:
- A fast (possibly the fastest?) command-line argument parser for JS
- An ergonomic API wrapper for Jamf School
- [Fig](https://fig.io), as the lead support engineer
  - Wrote completions for _big_ CLIs like `deno`, `bun`, and `op` (1Password)
 
I have a couple of old projects on PyPI that I won't link to because they haunt me, but the total downloads are something like 40,000 ðŸ˜¬
