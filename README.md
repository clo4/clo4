I currently work at a tech startup in the real estate industry. In my spare time, I like to work on little hobby projects, toy with [Nix](https://github.com/clo4/nix-dotfiles), and maintain [my Minecraft data packs](https://modrinth.com/user/clo4) ([all open source](https://github.com/clo4/datapacks), of course).

Previously I worked at [Fig](https://fig.io), which has since become Amazon Q. I wrote the fastest, fully complete [JavaScript command-line argument parser](https://github.com/clo4/run-fig) (archived) using the Fig CLI schema.

While I was working in IT, I also wrote a [Jamf School API library](https://github.com/clo4/deno_jamf_school), working around its *numerous* quirks, bugs, and lack of documentation ([1](https://github.com/clo4/deno_jamf_school/blob/354f4a22a294a1da04d348b48a6aadf486d1623c/src/internal/api.ts#L180-L182), [2](https://github.com/clo4/deno_jamf_school/blob/354f4a22a294a1da04d348b48a6aadf486d1623c/src/internal/device.ts#L18-L19), [3](https://github.com/clo4/deno_jamf_school/blob/354f4a22a294a1da04d348b48a6aadf486d1623c/src/internal/api.ts#L99-L106), [4](https://github.com/clo4/deno_jamf_school/blob/354f4a22a294a1da04d348b48a6aadf486d1623c/src/internal/profile.ts#L107), I could go on), and I wrote a bunch of other libraries necessary for it including [deno_mock_fetch](https://github.com/clo4/deno_mock_fetch) and [apple_device_identifiers](https://github.com/clo4/apple_device_identifiers).

I have a lot of old projects on my profile, and a also a few really old Python projects that I wrote that have over 200,000 downloads in total on PyPI.
