Previously I was the lead support engineer at [Fig](https://fig.io) (which has since become Amazon Q) and maintainer of [withfig/autocomplete](https://github.com/withfig/autocomplete). By my measurements at the time, I wrote the fastest fully complete [JavaScript command-line argument parser](https://github.com/clo4/run-fig) but abandoned it because it encourages creating a worse end-user experience since cold start single execution programs are a worst-case scenario for V8.

While I was working in IT, I also wrote an excellent [API wrapper for the Jamf School MDM](https://github.com/clo4/deno_jamf_school), and a bunch of other libraries necessary for it including [deno_mock_fetch](https://github.com/clo4/deno_mock_fetch) and [apple_device_identifiers](https://github.com/clo4/apple_device_identifiers).

There's also a few really old Python projects that I wrote that have over 200,000 downloads in total on PyPI.
