### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a developer based in Sydney. I'm interested in basically anything obscure and cool - like Nix, ergonomic keyboards and input systems, different editior paradigms, terminal emulators...

Previously I was the lead support engineer at [Fig](https://fig.io) and a maintainer of [withfig/autocomplete](https://github.com/withfig/autocomplete), and was a very frequent contributor to it too! I wrote possibly the fastest (?) [command-line argument parser for JS/TS](https://github.com/clo4/run-fig) but abandoned it because, in general, it's a worse experience for the user overall when the CLI isn't written in a compiled language.

I also wrote the best<sup>\*</sup> [API wrapper for Jamf School](https://github.com/clo4/deno_jamf_school), and a bunch of other libraries necessary for it including [deno_mock_fetch](https://github.com/clo4/deno_mock_fetch) and [apple_device_identifiers](https://github.com/clo4/apple_device_identifiers).

<sup>* it has no competition, but it's great anyway</sup>

There's also a couple of really old Python projects that I wrote that have over 100,000 downloads in total on PyPI, but it's honestly been so long that it's easier to pretend they don't exist.
